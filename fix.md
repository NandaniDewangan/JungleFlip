The extra space you're seeing on mobile devices is likely caused by a combination of factors:

1. **`overflow-x: hidden;` and `overflow-y: hidden;`:**  These properties hide content that overflows the container, but they don't prevent the browser from *allocating* space for that potential overflow. 

2. **`background-size: cover;`:** This property scales the background image to cover the entire container, but it might result in the image being stretched or cropped, leading to a mismatch between the image size and the container size.

3. **`width: 100vw;` and `height: 100vh;`:** These properties attempt to make the `background` container occupy the entire viewport width and height. However, on mobile, the viewport might include extra space for browser UI elements like the address bar and the tab bar.

Here's how you can address these issues and ensure consistent behavior across different devices:

**1.  Remove `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`**

   * **Solution:** Instead of using `overflow-x: hidden` and `overflow-y: hidden`, consider adjusting your content so that it doesn't overflow the container in the first place. This might involve adding scrollbars if necessary.

**2.  Adjust `background-size`**

   * **Solution:** If you want the background image to be scaled down without stretching, you can use `background-size: contain;`. This will ensure the image fits entirely within the container while maintaining its aspect ratio.

**3.  Account for Viewport Changes**

   * **Solution:** Use a combination of `vw` and `vh` units with media queries to adjust the `width` and `height` properties of your `.background` container based on the viewport size. For instance:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) { 
  .background {
    width: 100vw;
    height: calc(100vh - 48px);  /* Adjust 48px to the height of your status bar */
  }
}
```

                width: 100vw;
                height: calc(100vh - 48px); /* Adjust 48px if needed */
            }
        }

        .background img {
            display: block;
            max-width: 100%;
            margin-bottom: 2rem;
